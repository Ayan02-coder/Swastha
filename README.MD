## Introduction

**Swastha** is an advanced Electronic Health Record (EHR) system designed specifically for the Indian healthcare ecosystem. The project aims to enhance patient engagement and streamline the management of health records through a gamified approach. Swastha utilizes machine learning to analyze patient data, focusing on mental health metrics like anxiety, depression, and stress.

## Features

- **Gamified Patient Questionnaires**: Engages patients by transforming traditional forms into interactive and game-like experiences.
- **Data Visualization**: Provides a timeline format for visualizing patient data, making it easier to track health changes over time.
- **Multilingual Summaries**: Generates summaries in multiple languages to accommodate diverse patient demographics.
- **Machine Learning Analysis**: Implements several machine learning algorithms (SVM, Naive Bayes, Random Forest, Decision Tree) to identify mental health conditions based on patient data.
- **Mental Health Focus**: Specializes in diagnosing anxiety, depression, and stress using the DASS dataset.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Languages**: Python
- **Machine Learning Frameworks**: Scikit-Learn, LangChain
- **Data Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Database**: SQLite (or specify if another is used)
- **Other Tools**: Jupyter Notebook, Pandas, NumPy

## Dataset

The project uses the **Depression Anxiety Stress Scales (DASS)** dataset, which contains information necessary to analyze mental health conditions. The dataset includes patient responses and various health metrics that are crucial for training the machine learning models.

## Installation

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/swastha.git
   cd swastha
